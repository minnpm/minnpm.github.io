<p><strong>Wasm/k</strong> (WebAssembly continuations) is an extension of WebAssembly with additional primitive instructions that offer
support for full first-class continuations, very similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call/cc</code> in Scheme / Racket. These instructions allow
for significantly more efficient implementations of high-level language features such as green threads.
<strong>Wasm/k</strong> consists of three parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A fork of <strong>Wasmtime</strong>, a JIT implementation of WebAssembly, which implements the additional instructions of <strong>Wasm/k</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>C/k</strong>, a wrapper around <a href="https://emscripten.org">Emscripten</a> which exposes first-class continuations to C, and compiles them to <strong>Wasm/k</strong>.</li>
  <li><a href="/FullVersion.pdf">Our paper</a>, which includes the full formal definition of <strong>Wasm/k</strong> and proofs of safety.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="wasmtime">Wasmtime</h2>

<p>Wasmtime is a JIT for WebAssembly implemented in Rust. We extended Wasmtime in a fork to support Wasm/k.
Building our fork of Wasmtime also depends on our forks of a few other Rust WebAssembly toolchain libraries.
Please see the <a href="https://github.com/donald-pinckney/WasmContinuations">instructions for building our fork of Wasmtime</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ck">C/k</h2>

<p>C/k can be used to compile C/C++ which uses first class continuations
to Wasm/k code, which can then be run in the modified Wasmtime JIT.
C/k is implemented as a set of wrapper scripts around Emscripten / WASI-SDK.
Please see the <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/emcc_control/">instructions for installing C/k</a>.</p>
